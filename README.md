my projects name is zone connections 
its a student portal 
My student portal project's main goal is to give students a thorough online platform to effectively manage their academic journey. The portal attempts to make many facets of student life more user-friendly, from course registration to academic record access.
I handled all aspect of the project as a lone developer, including project management, design, development, and testing. The project's schedule covered several months, from the first stages of preparation to the release of the finished product
