Zone connections is a student portal 
The software will provide a platform in which the users will be able to enter, personal learning
theories, notes and questions, I enabler, Moodle management and archive the tentative
(unconfirmed) student marks as the student’s complete various assessments throughout the
year.
The purpose of the system is to help the student to track his/her academic progress throughout
the year and to minimize the errors in recorded marks.
It will describe the features and the interfaces of the software and what the software will do and
how the software will respond external input.
The software will record the student’s, course-coordinators and the school administrator’s
information.
It will also record courses information for every semester and year for the students to view to
their satisfaction.
